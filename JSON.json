The project will leverage AI to transform how coastal communities in Bangladesh respond to climate threats through the following pathway:\n\n**IF** we develop an AI-powered early warning system that integrates traditional knowledge with advanced climate data analytics, and **IF** we ensure this system is co-designed with and governed by local communities with particular attention to vulnerable groups, **THEN** communities will have access to more accurate, timely, and actionable climate information. **IF** communities have improved access to actionable climate information and are trained to interpret and respond to these warnings, **THEN** they will make more informed decisions about agricultural practices, fishing activities, and disaster preparedness. **IF** communities implement these improved practices and preparedness measures, **THEN** their vulnerability to climate impacts will decrease, leading to improved food security, reduced economic losses, and enhanced community resilience.\n\nThis theory is built on several key assumptions: 1) AI algorithms can be effectively trained using both scientific data and traditional knowledge; 2) Communities will trust and act upon the warnings when they participate in system design and governance; 3) Local government and institutional partners will support and help sustain the early warning infrastructure; and 4) The benefits of improved climate information will be equitably distributed across different community groups when explicit inclusion mechanisms are implemented.\n\nIntermediate outcomes that will contribute to our overall goal include: increased community capacity to interpret climate information, strengthened local governance structures for climate action, improved coordination between traditional knowledge holders and technical experts, and enhanced adaptive agricultural and fishing practices. These outcomes align directly with Klarna's objectives for climate adaptation in vulnerable regions and the emphasis on practical implementation of AI solutions with strong local ownership.\n\n## Gender and Social Inclusion Strategy\n\nOur gender and social inclusion strategy addresses structural barriers to ensure equitable participation and benefit-sharing across the project. Women in coastal Bangladesh often have limited access to information, technology, and decision-making processes despite being disproportionately affected by climate impacts. Similarly, youth, elderly, and ethnic minorities face unique vulnerabilities and exclusion from traditional warning systems.\n\nTo address these challenges, we will implement a multi-faceted approach:\n\nFirst, we will conduct an inclusive stakeholder mapping at project inception to identify power dynamics, barriers to participation, and specific needs of different groups. This will inform the co-design process for the AI system, ensuring the warning formats, dissemination channels, and response protocols address gender-specific and group-specific vulnerabilities. For example, warnings will be available in multiple formats (voice, text, visual) and languages to accommodate varying literacy levels and accessibility needs.\n\nSecond, we will establish gender-balanced and socially inclusive governance committees for the early warning system, with mandated representation (minimum 50% women and 30% from other vulnerable groups) and decision-making authority. These committees will participate in all phases from design to implementation, ensuring the system addresses diverse needs and perspectives.\n\nThird, we will implement targeted capacity building programs for women and marginalized groups on both technical aspects (using the warning system, interpreting data) and leadership skills to strengthen their role in community climate governance. This includes creating safe spaces for women to participate in training and decision-making, scheduling activities to accommodate women's time constraints, and providing childcare support when needed.\n\nWe will track progress through gender-disaggregated indicators and regular participatory assessments to ensure the project addresses power imbalances rather than reinforcing them. These measures align directly with Klarna's emphasis on equity and ensuring benefits reach the most vulnerable community members.\n\n## Sustainability and Exit Strategy\n\nOur sustainability approach centers on building local ownership, capacity, and institutional arrangements from the outset to ensure the early warning system continues functioning effectively after grant funding ends. We will implement a three-phase sustainability strategy:\n\nIn the foundation phase (months 1-8), we will establish the governance structure with clear roles for community committees, local government, and technical partners. The system will be co-designed with sustainability in mind, using locally appropriate technology and existing infrastructure where possible. We will identify local champions and begin training them as system administrators and community trainers.\n\nIn the transition phase (months 9-18), we will gradually shift operational responsibilities to local stakeholders. This includes transferring technical maintenance skills, establishing data management protocols, and creating standard operating procedures for system updates. We will work with local government to integrate the early warning system into their disaster management plans and budget cycles. Community committees will take increasing responsibility for system governance, with the project team shifting to an advisory role.\n\nIn the consolidation phase (months 19-24), we will focus on financial sustainability through multiple pathways. This includes advocating for local government budget allocation, exploring potential public-private partnerships for system maintenance, and developing a minimal-cost operating model that communities can sustain. We will document the entire process, creating manuals and training materials that remain with the community.\n\nThe AI system itself will be designed with sustainability principles: open-source where possible, modular to allow for updates without complete overhauls, and with transparent documentation to prevent dependency on specific vendors or experts. All intellectual property will remain with the community, and the AI models will be trained to continuously improve with minimal external support.\n\nThis approach directly addresses Klarna's emphasis on local ownership and long-term sustainability beyond the grant period, ensuring the technology serves community needs appropriately over time.\n\n## Partnership Framework\n\nOur partnership framework brings together complementary expertise and establishes clear roles and responsibilities for effective project implementation. The partnership structure includes:\n\n**Lead Organization (Climate Resilience Bangladesh)**: Responsible for overall project management, coordination, donor reporting, and financial accountability. CRB brings 15 years of experience working with coastal communities on climate adaptation and has established relationships with local governments in the target region.\n\n**Technical Partner (AI for Good Institute)**: Provides expertise in AI system development, responsible AI governance, and technical training. AIGI will lead the development of the AI algorithms, working closely with local knowledge holders to ensure the system integrates scientific and traditional knowledge effectively.\n\n**Local Implementation Partners**:\n- **Coastal Community Development Forum**: A network of community-based organizations representing 15 coastal villages, they will mobilize community participation, facilitate co-design processes, and lead the community governance committees.\n- **Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD)**: Will provide access to climate and weather data, technical validation of the early warning outputs, and integration with national early warning infrastructure.\n- **Local Government Engineering Department**: Will support infrastructure needs and help institutionalize the system within local disaster management plans.\n\n**Research and Learning Partner (Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology)**: Will document lessons learned, support monitoring and evaluation, and help refine the AI models based on performance data.\n\nEach partner brings specific strengths that address key components of the project. The partnership model emphasizes shared decision-making through a steering committee with representation from all partners and community representatives. Regular coordination meetings (monthly at the implementation level, quarterly at the strategic level) will ensure alignment and adaptive management.\n\nThe partnership leverages existing relationships and infrastructure rather than creating parallel structures. Formal memoranda of understanding will be established at project inception, clearly outlining roles, responsibilities, and resource allocation. The partnership structure deliberately builds in redundancies for critical functions to enhance resilience and sustainability.\n\nThis framework directly addresses Klarna's emphasis on local ownership, equitable partnerships, and having established presence on the ground - essential elements for successful implementation of AI-powered climate adaptation solutions.",
