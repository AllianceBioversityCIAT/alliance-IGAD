RFP Analysis\n\nA structured analysis of the RFP, including donor priorities, eligibility, thematic focus, geographic expectations, tone, and evaluation criteria.\n\n{{rfp_analysis}}\n\n### 2. Concept Evaluation\n\nA structured JSON object containing:\n- fit_assessment\n- strong_aspects\n- **sections_needing_elaboration** → each section includes:\n    - section\n    - issue\n    - priority\n    - suggestions\n    - **selected: true/false** ← indicates whether this section must appear in the improved concept note\n\n{{concept_evaluation}}\n\n### 3. Initial Concept\n\nThe user’s original concept note or project idea.\n\n{{initial_concept}}\n\n---\n\n## Structure of the Improved Concept Note (Mandatory)\n\nThe improved concept note must contain **exactly the following structure**:\n\n### **A. Three Introductory Mandatory Sections (Always Included)**\n1. **Executive Summary**  \n2. **Problem Context**  \n3. **Proposed Approach**\n\nThese 3 sections are *always generated*, regardless of user selection.\n\n### **B. Technical Sections (Conditional Inclusion)**\n- After the three introductory sections, include **only the technical sections that have `\"selected\": true\"`** in the Concept Evaluation.\n\n- Include a technical section **only if** its `\"selected\"` flag is true.\n\n- Maintain the original order shown above.\n\n- Do **not**:\n  - Include sections with `\"selected\": false`.\n  - Rename these sections.\n  - Add new standalone sections outside this list.\n\n- If the initial concept includes additional ideas (rationale, background, beneficiaries, etc.), integrate them **into the appropriate section**, but do not create new ones.\n\n---\n\n## Generation Guidelines\n\n### 1. Use the Concept Evaluation to Strengthen Selected Sections\nFor each technical section with `\"selected\": true`:\n- Address the **issues** identified in concept evaluation \n- Follow the **suggestions** as improvement guidance  \n- Address “Critical” items with extra clarity  \n- Include “Recommended” items when supported by available information  \n- Include “Optional” items only if they fit naturally and do not require fabrication\n\nDo not generate content for sections marked `\"selected\": false`.\nThe Concept Evaluation guides *how to improve*, not *what to invent*.\n\n### 2. Use the RFP Analysis to Align the Narrative\nEnsure the improved concept note reflects:\n- Donor thematic priorities\n- Geographic eligibility\n- Implementation expectations\n- RFP evaluation and scoring criteria\n- Required tone and framing\n\n### 3. Use Only Available Information\nBase your writing strictly on:\n- RFP Analysis  \n- Initial Concept  \n- Concept Evaluation  \n\nDo **not** invent:\n- New data or indicators\n- New partners or institutions\n- Locations not mentioned\n- Numbers, baselines, or statistics\n- New activities, technologies, deliverables, or outcomes not supported by the inputs \n\nIf a suggestion in concept evaluation requests detail that is missing from the inputs, acknowledge it briefly (e.g., “Specific baseline information is not available in the current inputs.”).\n\n### 4. Introductory Sections\nYou must generate these sections even if the initial concept lacks detail:\n- Executive Summary\n- Problem Context\n- Proposed Approach\n\nThese sections should synthesize:\n- Relevant parts of the initial concept\n- Donor expectations from the RFP\n- Strengths and alignment insights from the Concept Evaluation\n\n### 5. Human-Centered Framing\nWhen appropriate, emphasize:\n- Local ownership and participatory processes  \n- Inclusion, equity, and gender considerations  \n- Climate resilience and vulnerability reduction  \n- Responsible and ethical use of technologies  \n\n### 6. Internal Consistency\nEnsure consistency across:\n- Activities  \n- Beneficiaries  \n- Geographic focus  \n- Partnerships  \n- Risk and sustainability strategies  \n\nAvoid contradictions or mismatched details.\n\n---"

                "S": "### **Outline Design Guidelines** \n\nWhen building the proposal outline: \n\n1. **Respect Donor Structure and Integrate Concept Evaluation Findings**\n\n- If the RFP specifies sections (e.g., Executive Summary, Problem Statement, Methodology, Budget, M&E Plan), use them exactly as stated.  \n\n- Additionally, you MUST incorporate all “Sections Needing Elaboration” identified in the Concept Evaluation. Each of these sections must appear in the outline as its own distinct section, unless the donor already includes it in their structure.\n\n- For each elaboration section from the Concept Evaluation:\n  \n  - Use the section name exactly as provided\n  \n  - Use the priority level (“Critical”, “Recommended”, “Optional”) to influence emphasis, placement, and suggested word count\n\n  - Use the issue description to inform the purpose and content_guidance fields\n\n  - Expand into 2–4 guiding_questions based on the issue and donor expectations\n\n- Critical sections should receive proportionally higher word counts or greater detail.\n\n- Recommended and Optional sections should appear after Critical sections unless otherwise required by the RFP.\n\n- When the RFP structure already covers a concept-evaluation section (e.g., “Monitoring Framework”), merge the information: do not duplicate, but embed the evaluation insights into the existing donor-specified section.\n\n2. **Allocate Word Counts**  \n\n- Base relative word counts or proportions on the RFP’s evaluation weights (e.g., if “Relevance” = 25%, allocate roughly 25% of total length to related sections).  \n\n- If no weights exist, assign logical weights prioritizing relevance, feasibility, sustainability, and impact. \n\n3. **Generate Guiding Questions**  \n\n- Create 2–4 questions per section to guide content development (e.g., “What specific problem does the project address and why is it important to the donor?”).  \n\n- Ensure each question is specific, action-oriented, and aligned with the donor’s evaluation criteria. \n\n4. **Integrate Concept Insights**  \n\n- Reinforce sections where alignment is strong.  \n\n- Add new sections or guiding questions for identified gaps (e.g., gender strategy, M&E framework, sustainability plan). \n\n5. **Human-Centered Flow**  \n\n- Structure sections in logical order for proposal writing (flow from context → solution → impact → sustainability).  \n\n- Keep titles clear and self-explanatory. \n\n--- \n\n### **Output Format (Mandatory)** \n\nYour final response must contain two parts in this order: \n\n#### 1. Narrative Overview \n\nProvide a short text summary (2–3 paragraphs) explaining how the outline reflects the RFP requirements and addresses the concept’s strengths and weaknesses. \n\n#### 2.

Identify and Evaluate Sections**\n- Detect all section titles and subsections from the draft proposal.\n- Treat each section independently for feedback.\n\n### **2. Assign a Quality Tag**\nFor each section, assign one of the following:\n\n- **Excellent** → Very strong alignment with RFP; clear, specific, well-structured, and complete. Only minor refinements needed.\n- **Good** → Generally aligned and clear, but with some gaps, lack of specificity, or opportunities to improve structure or evidence.\n- **Needs improvement** → Important issues in alignment, clarity, completeness, or structure. Significant revision required.\n\n### **3. Provide Detailed AI Feedback**\n- Provide a detailed paragraph (or more if needed) explaining:\n  - What is working well in this section\n  - What is missing or unclear\n  - How it aligns (or not) with specific RFP expectations\n- Use precise, constructive language, not generic comments.\n\n### **4. Provide Actionable Suggestions per section**\n- Offer **3–7 specific, actionable recommendations** for improving each section.  \n- Suggestions should guide the user on what to add, expand, clarify, or restructure.\n- Suggestions should be actionable, for example:\n  - “Add a paragraph clarifying how the proposed activities directly address the donor’s priority on gender equity.”\n  - “Provide 1–2 concrete examples or data points to support the problem statement.”\n  - “Clarify roles and responsibilities of each partner organization in the implementation approach.”\n\n### **5. Maintain Donor Alignment**\n- Where relevant, reference RFP elements (criteria, wording, or focus areas) in your feedback and suggestions.\n- If the proposal contradicts or ignores a requirement in the RFP, highlight this clearly.\n\n### **6. Tone and Style**\nUse professional, direct, and constructive language.  \nAvoid rewriting the proposal; instead, give guidance.\n\n---"
