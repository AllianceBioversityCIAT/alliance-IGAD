Concept Evaluation**\n\nA structured JSON object with:\n- fit_assessment  \n- strong_aspects  \n- sections_needing_elaboration → each includes:\n  - section  \n  - issue  \n  - priority  \n  - suggestions  \n  - **selected: true/false** ← determines inclusion\n  - **user_comments** (optional) ← additional notes written by the user\n\n<CONCEPT_EVALUATION>\n{{concept_evaluation}}\n</CONCEPT_EVALUATION>\n\nYou must:\n- Use this object to guide improvements,\n- Include only the `\"selected\": true` sections,\n- Strengthen each selected section using the provided issues, priorities, and suggestions,\n- Address \"Critical\" issues very clearly,\n- Include \"Recommended\" issues where inputs support them,\n- Include \"Optional\" items only when they do not require fabrication.\n- Treat \"user_comments\" as additional guidance or orientation from the user; use them to enrich and clarify the section only when consistent with the inputs.\n\n### **3. Initial Concept**\n\nThe user's original concept note.\n\n<INITIAL_CONCEPT_TEXT>\n{{initial_concept}}\n</INITIAL_CONCEPT_TEXT>\n\nThis is the core narrative basis.  \nYou must preserve and strengthen its ideas using the other inputs.\n\n### **4. Reference Proposal Analysis**\n\nA narrative and structured analysis of reference proposals, extracted earlier.\n\n<REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n{{reference_proposals_analysis}}\n</REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n\nUse this **only** for:\n- structural patterns,\n- writing logic,\n- narrative flow,\n- clarity and coherence strategies,\n- tone and rhetorical techniques,\n- donor-preferred presentation style.\n\nDo **not** copy content or data from reference proposals.\n\n### **5.

Three Introductory Mandatory Sections**\nThese sections must always appear:\n\n1. **Executive Summary**  \n2. **Problem Context**  \n3. **Proposed Approach**\n\nAll three sections must:\n- Integrate information from all inputs,\n- Strengthen clarity and alignment from the initial concept,\n- Reflect donor expectations extracted from the RFP,\n- Incorporate organizational experience when relevant,\n- Use structural and narrative best practices from reference proposals.\n\n### **B. Technical Sections (Conditional)**\n\nAfter the three introductory sections, include **only** the sections in the Concept Evaluation where `\"selected\": true\"`.\n\nRules:\n- Include each selected section with **exactly its given title**.\n- Do not add new sections or rename existing ones.\n- Follow the order in which the sections appear in the Concept Evaluation input.\n- Use the Concept Evaluation to determine:\n  - what must be strengthened,\n  - what suggestions to integrate,\n  - which priorities require more emphasis.\n\n---\n\n## **Generation Guidelines**\n\n### **1. Strengthen Selected Sections Using Concept Evaluation**\n\nFor each section marked `\"selected\": true\"`:\n- Address the issues explicitly,\n- Incorporate suggestions when supported by available facts,\n- Give special emphasis to \"Critical\" items,\n- Avoid unsupported claims,\n- Clearly acknowledge missing data when necessary (\"Specific baseline information is not provided in the inputs.\").\n- Use \"user_comments\" as additional guidance to refine tone, emphasis, clarity, or direction for the section — but do not treat them as new facts unless they repeat information already present in other inputs.\n\n### **2. Align the Narrative with the RFP Analysis**\n\nReflect:\n- Donor thematic priorities,\n- Eligible geographies,\n- Expected approaches and methodologies,\n- Required cross-cutting themes (gender, climate resilience, inclusion),\n- Evaluation criteria (relevance, innovation, feasibility, sustainability),\n- Tone and communication preferences.\n\n### **3. Use Existing Work & Experience to Strengthen Credibility**\n\nYou must integrate relevant institutional experience into:\n- Executive Summary,\n- Problem Context (where appropriate),\n- Proposed Approach,\n- Any selected technical sections requiring demonstration of capacity.\n\nAll references must come **only** from the Existing Work input.\n\n### **4. Use Reference Proposal Analysis for Style & Structure**\n\nApply:\n- structural clarity,\n- logical flow,\n- narrative coherence,\n- concise evidence framing,\n- clear transitions and signposting.\n\nDo not use reference proposal content.\n\n### **5. Human-Centered Framing**\n\nWhen appropriate, emphasize:\n- participatory design,\n- gender and inclusion,\n- climate resilience,\n- local ownership,\n- ethical and responsible use of technology.\n\nUse clear, accessible language.\n\n### **6. Internal Consistency Requirements**\n\nAll sections must be:\n- logically connected,\n- consistent in geography, partners, beneficiaries, and activities,\n- coherent and non-contradictory,\n- aligned with the inputs.\n\nIf the initial concept contains inconsistencies, resolve them using:\n- what is most consistent with the RFP analysis,\n- what is most consistent with Existing Work.\n\nNever invent missing details to resolve inconsistencies.\n\n---",

Strong Aspects of the Proposal**\n\nList **4–6 concise bullet points** that reflect strong alignment with the RFP. These must be:\n\n- specific to this concept note, and  \n- traceable to actual content in the concept text.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Clear focus on climate resilience and adaptation strategies.  \n- Strong regional partnership network across IGAD member states.  \n- Innovative use of digital tools and AI for agricultural decision-making.  \n- Demonstrated institutional experience in regional knowledge management.  \n\n#### **3.

Missing or very weak content here may lead to rejection or major loss of points.  \n   - \"Recommended\" → Important for competitiveness and clarity but not strictly required for eligibility.  \n   - \"Optional\" → Valuable additions that enhance quality but have limited effect on compliance or scoring.  \n4. **suggestions** – a list of actionable recommendations detailing what the user could add or clarify to strengthen this section.\n\nDo **not** include generic or template-based sections. Only list sections that are genuinely missing or underdeveloped in this specific concept note.\nIntegrate insights from reference proposal analysis and existing work where relevant.\n\n#### **4. Strategic Verdict**\n\nConclude with a short paragraph summarizing overall readiness and which areas require attention to improve competitiveness. For example:\n\n> “Based on this analysis, the proposal shows [strong/moderate/limited] readiness for submission to the RFP. Addressing [specific gaps] could significantly improve competitiveness.”\n\nThis paragraph must be consistent with the `alignment_level` used in the Fit Assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **JSON Output Schema**\n\nAfter your narrative sections, include a valid JSON block structured as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"fit_assessment\": { \n    \"alignment_level\": \"\", \n    \"justification\": \"\", \n    \"confidence\": \"\" \n  },\n  \"strong_aspects\": [\"\"], \n  \"sections_needing_elaboration\": [ \n    { \n      \"section\": \"\", \n      \"issue\": \"\", \n      \"priority\": \"Critical | Recommended | Optional\",\n      \"suggestions\": [\"\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"strategic_verdict\": \"\" \n}\n```",

User Concept Note**\n\nThe user’s concept note text (initial project idea or draft concept) is provided below:\n\n<INITIAL_CONCEPT_TEXT>\n{{initial_concept}}\n</INITIAL_CONCEPT_TEXT>\n\nThis is the primary content to evaluate and compare against the RFP and other inputs.\nYou must evaluate **only** what is actually written inside this block.  \nDo not assume that the concept covers something unless it is explicitly present.\n\n### **3. Reference Proposal Analysis**\n\n<REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n{{reference_proposal_analysis}}\n</REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n\nUse this input to detect structural expectations, common thematic components, and narrative logic typical of strong proposals.\n\n### **4. Existing Work & Experience**\n\n<EXISTING_WORK_TEXT>\n{{existing_work_analysis}}\n</EXISTING_WORK_TEXT>\n\nUse it to refine:\n- completeness checks,\n- feasibility evaluation,\n- suggestions for missing or underdeveloped sections.\n\n---\n\n## **Use of Reference Proposal Analysis**\n\nYou must leverage the reference proposal analysis to:\n\n- identify **structural and narrative expectations** common to successful proposals,\n- detect **missing sections** that are typically required by the donor even if the RFP is not explicit,\n- identify important components (e.g., gender, risks, sustainability, partnerships, ToC, M&E) missing from the concept.\n\nYou must **not** use reference proposal content directly — only its structural and stylistic patterns.\n\nReference Proposals = **guide for structure and expectations**, not content to copy.\n\n---\n\n## **Use of Existing Work & Experience**\n\nYou must use the Existing Work input to:\n\n- assess whether the concept sufficiently leverages organizational strengths,\n- identify gaps where relevant experience could be integrated,\n- improve the quality of your suggestions in “sections_needing_elaboration”,\n- determine feasibility and credibility more accurately.\n\nYou must **not** fabricate new institutional experience.  \nYou may point out when the concept fails to use information available in this input.\n\nExisting Work = **context for stronger suggestions**, not a source of invented details.\n\n---\n\n## **Your Objectives**\n\n1. **Evaluate Alignment**\n\nAssess the alignment between the concept and the RFP, considering:\n\n- **Thematic priorities** (e.g., climate, gender, innovation, food systems, etc.)  \n- **Geographic focus** (eligible regions, target populations)  \n- **Methodological or implementation approach** (research design, partnerships, delivery model, scalability, etc.)\n\nYou must explicitly reference elements from:\n- RFP priorities (from the analysis), and  \n- Concept content (from the concept note)  \nto justify your assessment.\n\n2. **Assess Completeness**\n\nDetermine whether the concept provides enough information to move forward to full proposal writing:\n\n- Check coverage of core components such as: objectives, problem statement, methodology, expected outcomes, target groups, partnerships, and (if applicable) budget logic or sustainability.\n- Identify which components are:\n  - **well covered**\n  - **present but weak/underdeveloped**\n  - **completely missing**\n\nWhen information is clearly missing or extremely vague, state: `\"insufficient data provided in concept note\"`.\n\n3. **Rate Evaluation Fit**\n\nCompare the concept against the RFP’s evaluation and scoring criteria:\n\n- Use the evaluation criteria from the RFP analysis (e.g., relevance, innovation, feasibility, sustainability, gender, scaling potential).\n- For each major evaluation dimension, assess whether the concept:\n  - aligns strongly,\n  - aligns partially,\n  - or does not align / is not addressed.\n\nSummarize how these comparisons justify your overall fit assessment.\n\n4. **Provide Human-Centered Feedback (HCD Integration)**\n\n- Use **clear, non-technical language** so the user understands what to fix and why.\n- Offer **specific**, actionable suggestions (e.g., “Add a clear outcome statement describing…” rather than “Improve clarity”).\n- Include a **confidence indicator**: \"High\", \"Medium\", or \"Low\", based on how detailed the concept is.\n- If major sections are missing or the concept is very vague, explicitly state: `\"insufficient data provided in concept note\"` and lower your confidence accordingly.\n\n5. **Strategic Readiness Verdict**\n\nProvide an overall judgement on whether the concept is:\n\n- ready to move into full proposal drafting with minor refinements,  \n- requires moderate revision before drafting, or  \n- requires substantial rethinking before continuing.\n\n---\n\n## **Evaluation Dimensions**\n\nUse the following dimensions to structure your thinking:\n\n### 1. **Alignment**\n- Thematic relevance: Does the concept clearly address the donor's core topics?  \n- Geographic fit: Is the target region/country eligible and consistent with the RFP’s focus?  \n- Methodological approach: Does it align with donor expectations? (research design, partnerships, scale, feasibility, etc.)\n- Assess whether the concept aligns with structural expectations based on reference proposals.\n\n### 2. **Completeness**\n- Are all key components (e.g., problem, objectives, methods, outcomes, target groups, partnerships, implementation logic, feasibility, sustainability, risks) sufficiently described?\n- Identify **specifically** what is:\n  - fully covered,\n  - partially covered (underdeveloped),\n  - missing.\n\n### 3. **Evaluation Fit**\n- How does the concept perform against the main evaluation criteria from the RFP?\n- Highlight **convergences** and **divergences**, with concrete examples from the concept note.\n\n### 4. **Human-Centered Feedback**\n- Focus on clarity, actionable insights, and concrete guidance.\n- Avoid abstract comments like “improve alignment”; instead state **what** to add or change and **why**.\n\n---",

Use of Subsections**\n\nYou may introduce subsections **within** a section when appropriate (e.g., within “Implementation Plan” or “MELIA Framework”), such as:\n- Activities and Workplan\n- Roles and Responsibilities\n- Indicators and Data Collection\n- Learning and Adaptive Management\n\nSubsections must:\n- remain clearly under the parent section,\n- not function as standalone sections.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Human-Centered and Donor-Aligned Writing**\n\nEnsure the draft:\n- is clear and readable,\n- uses professional donor language,\n- emphasizes relevance, feasibility, and impact,\n- highlights inclusion, gender, climate resilience, and learning where relevant,\n- supports collaborative review and refinement.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Internal Consistency**\n\nCheck that:\n- objectives align with activities and outcomes,\n- geography and beneficiaries are consistent across sections,\n- institutional roles align with existing work,\n- risks, MELIA, and sustainability are coherent with the approach.\n\nIf inconsistencies exist in the inputs, prioritize:\n- alignment with the RFP,\n- alignment with the improved concept.\n\nNever invent details to resolve inconsistencies.\n\n---",

RFP Analysis**\n\n<RFP_ANALYSIS>\n{{rfp_analysis}}\n</RFP_ANALYSIS>\n\nUse this to determine:\n- whether the donor specifies a proposal structure,  \n- required sections,  \n- evaluation criteria and weights,  \n- tone and style,  \n- mandatory components (gender, MELIA, risk, sustainability, workplan, partnerships, budget, etc.).\n\n### **2. Improved Concept Note**\n\n<IMPROVED_CONCEPT>\n{{concept_document_v2}}\n</IMPROVED_CONCEPT>\n\nUse this document to:\n- ensure conceptual alignment with the proposal structure,\n- extract key themes and logic to be reflected in the outline,\n- identify project direction, objectives, approach, beneficiaries, and alignment,\n- integrate gap areas that must evolve into proposal-level sections.\n\nDo NOT simply replicate the concept structure — the improved concept is **a base**, not the full proposal.\n\n### **3. Reference Proposal Analysis**\n\n<REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n{{reference_proposals_analysis}}\n</REFERENCE_PROPOSAL_ANALYSIS>\n\nUse this **only** to:\n- understand typical donor-preferred structures,\n- identify commonly required proposal sections,\n- validate section ordering and logical flow,\n- mirror narrative architecture used in strong proposals.\n\nDo NOT use content from the reference proposal.\n\n### **4. Existing Work & Experience Analysis**\n\n<EXISTING_WORK_ANALYSIS>\n{{existing_work_analysis}}\n</EXISTING_WORK_ANALYSIS>\n\nUse this to:\n- inform sections where institutional experience, capacity, or credibility must be highlighted (e.g., Implementation Plan, MELIA, Organizational Capacity, Partnerships),\n- ensure sections referencing expertise or track record are grounded in real information.\n\nDo NOT invent new experience or details beyond what is provided.\n\n---\n\n## **Your Objectives**\n\n### **1. Build a complete proposal outline**  \nYour outline must strictly follow the donor-required structure if the RFP provides one.  \nOtherwise, generate a complete, standard donor-compliant proposal structure.\n\n#### **Proposal Section Recommendations (Important Clarification)**\n\nWhen designing the proposal outline, you must not limit yourself to:\n- the sections explicitly mentioned in the RFP,  \n- the sections listed in this prompt, or  \n- the sections present in the improved concept.\n\nIn addition to these sources, you must also draw on your **general knowledge of standard proposal structures used by major donors**. \n\nIf the RFP does not fully specify a structure—which is common—you are expected to recommend a **complete set of proposal-appropriate sections**.  \nYour recommendations must:\n- reflect globally recognized best practices in proposal design,  \n- ensure the outline contains all essential components for a competitive proposal,  \n- introduce any missing sections the donor would reasonably expect.\n\nYour goal is to ensure the proposal outline is **comprehensive, competitive, and aligned with both donor expectations and international proposal standards**, even when the RFP provides minimal structural guidance.\n\n### **2. Integrate the Improved Concept**  \nUse the improved concept to:\n- define the backbone of the proposal,\n- ensure narrative coherence,\n- determine what proposal sections must elaborate further.\n\n### **3. Add required proposal-level sections**  \nBecause proposals require deeper detail, ALWAYS consider the need for:\n- Implementation Plan / Workplan\n- MELIA / Monitoring, Evaluation, Learning & Impact Assessment\n- Risk Identification & Mitigation\n- Sustainability & Scaling Strategy\n- Governance & Partnership Arrangements\n- Budget & Value for Money\n- Theory of Change (if donor-relevant or implied)\n- Gender & Social Inclusion Strategy\n- Environmental or Climate Integration (if part of donor lens)\n\n### **4. Ensure Non-Duplication**  \nThe mandatory sections:\n- Executive Summary  \n- Problem Context  \n- Proposed Approach  \n\nMUST NOT reappear in `proposal_outline` or be duplicated under different names.\n\n### **5. Assign Recommended Word Counts / Proportions**  \n- Use donor evaluation criteria weights where available.  \n- If absent, assign logical proportions based on standard donor practice.  \n- Critical or heavily weighted sections must have higher recommended word counts.\n\n### **6. Generate Guiding Questions (2–4 per section)**  \nQuestions must be:\n- specific,\n- action-oriented,\n- aligned with donor criteria,\n- easy for teams to respond to.\n\n### **7. Human-Centered Design (HCD)**  \nThe outline must:\n- be intuitive,  \n- flow logically,  \n- clearly support collaborative proposal development.\n\n---",
